# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project explores historical weather data for Hawaii, performing a detailed analysis of precipitation and temperature data, particularly focusing on a one-year period from August 2016 to August 2017. The goal is to utilize SQLAlchemy ORM to reflect tables from a SQLite database, analyze precipitation and station data, and visualize key insights using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

# Database Information

We use a SQLite database, hawaii.sqlite, which contains two tables:

measurement: Holds weather data, including precipitation and temperature observations.
station: Contains information about various weather stations in Hawaii.
